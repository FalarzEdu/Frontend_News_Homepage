    The choice
</h3>

Although this is a basic challenge it was my first try and i learned a lot in the process of building the website. Being a novice in the world of front end development i wanted to start small to assure that i would be able to finish the challenge and acquire some knowledge during the path - and i think i was successful.

<h3 id="dev">The development</h3>

For the design i tried to use both Flexbox, CSS Grid and its animation resources to familiarize myself with this tools. For this first try i decide i would not dive into JavaScript to focus on the visual elements.
